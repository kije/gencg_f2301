# Day 3 â€“ Clock

## The idea

import ClockIdeaSketch from "@/assets/day3/clock_sketch.jpg";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image src={ClockIdeaSketch} />
</div>

## Building the clock

### First step: darwing dots & make the clock tick

Let's start simple by making a line of dots and make the clock "tick" by moving the dots that represent the passed seconds "one spot" to the right.

### Second step: going around the corner

import ClockMovement from "@/assets/day3/clock_movement.jpg";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Image src={ClockMovement} width={PAGE_CONTENT_WIDTH / 1.5} />
</div>

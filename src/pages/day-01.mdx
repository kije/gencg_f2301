# Day 1 â€“ Intro

## Setup journal page with Next.js

Right from the start, it became clear to me that want to have something more flexible than the existing Github Pages generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would give me for the journal.

So I decided to quickly configure my own static site generation with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the journal page, which allows for easy integration of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) experiments as well.

## Computing without computers

### Variation on Sprouts

I liked the idea of the [Sprouts game](https://digitalideation.github.io/gencg_f2301/notes/day01/#john-h-conway--michael-s-patterson-sprouts-30-mns).

However, when I read the instructions for it, I immediately started to wonder what would happen if one would create an even more restricted, and in some sense more repetitive version of the game.
In particular, I wanted to restrict the shapes allowed in the game. My idea was to only allow two kinds of shapes: curved lines and $n$-sided shapes with only straight lines.

So I came up with the following rules to generate the drawings:

1. Decide on a number $n > 2$ . This will represent the number of sides of all shapes in the drawing with only straight lines
2. Draw $n$ points
3. Connect each of this newly drawn points to one other of the points.
4. Connect two of these points with a curved line, without crossing any other line already drawn in the drawing (it's ok though to start/end in a point that either joins two straight-lined shapes or even is the start/end of another curved line)
5. Now draw $n - 1$ new points
6. repeat at step 3. Consider the endpoint of the recently drawn curved line as a new point

### First P5.js experiment: Draw some simple shapes

_todo describe setup react & p5_

Since I haven't used p5.js before, I decided to start with the [exercise on drawing some simple shapes](https://digitalideation.github.io/gencg_f2301/notes/day01/#2-draw-then-code) with p5.js:

import { P5Tree } from "@/components/day1/P5Tree";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <P5Tree />
</div>

The code for this is pretty straightforward. I've added some [logic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5529199) to place the dots on the round tree at random positions inside the ellipse:

```js
function randomPointInEllipse(cx, cy, width, height) {
  // algo by: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5529199
  let rho = Math.random();
  let phi = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;

  // random coordinates inside the circle
  let x = Math.sqrt(rho) * Math.cos(phi);
  let y = Math.sqrt(rho) * Math.sin(phi);

  // scale to elipse
  x = (x * width) / 2.0;
  y = (y * height) / 2.0;

  return [cx + x, cy + y];
}

function drawRoundTree() {
  const cx = 100;
  const cy = 150;
  const width = 90;
  const height = 100;

  background(255, 0);
  clear();

  stroke(255, 255, 255);
  strokeWeight(4);
  noFill();

  // crown
  ellipse(cx, cy, width, height);
  // main trunk
  line(cx, cy - 15, cx, cy + 110);
  // side branch
  line(cx - 20, cy + 5, cx, cy + 35);

  // leaves
  for (let i = 0; i <= 50; i++) {
    const [x, y] = randomPointInEllipse(cx, cy, width, height);

    strokeWeight(Math.random() * 4);
    point(x, y);
  }
}
```

### EatTheCanvas

While trying to create an interactive version of the Sollewit wall drawing, I got inspired by a little "accident", which created a pattern that seemed to "eat" the canvas:

<br />

import { EatTheCanvas } from "@/components/day1/EatTheCanvas";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <EatTheCanvas />
</div>

### Sollewit

import { Sollewit } from "@/components/day1/Sollewit";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Sollewit />
</div>

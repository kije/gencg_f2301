# Day 1

## Setup journal page with Next.js

Right from the start, it became clear to me that I'll need to have some more flexibility with the journal page than the existing Github Pages generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) would give me.

For one, I plan to do some of the work/experiments in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [nannou](https://nannou.cc/).
Since Rust can be compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and run in the browser, it seemed like a good idea to have a setup that would allow me to integrate this directly into the journal page.

At the same time, this would also allow me to integrate [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) experiments as well.

So I decided to quickly configure my own static site generation with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the journal page.

## Variation on Sprouts

I liked the idea of the [Sprouts game](https://digitalideation.github.io/gencg_f2301/notes/day01/#john-h-conway--michael-s-patterson-sprouts-30-mns).

However, when I started to read the instruction for it, I immediately started to wonder what would happen if one would create an even more restricted, and in some sense more repetitive version of the game.
In particular, I wanted to restrict the shapes allowed in the game. My idea was to only allow two kinds of shapes: curved lines and $n$-sided shapes with only straight lines.

So I came up with the following rules to generate the drawings:

1. Decide on a number $n > 2$ . This will represent the number of sides of all shapes in the drawing with only straight lines
2. Draw $n$ points
3. Connect each of this newly drawn points to one other of the points.
4. Connect two of these points with a curved line, without crossing any other line already drawn in the drawing (it's ok though to start/end in a point that either joins two straight-lined shapes or even is the start/end of another curved line)
5. Now draw $n - 1$ new points
6. repeat at step 3. Consider the endpoint of the recently drawn curved line as a new point

## First P5.js experiment: Draw some simple shapes

todo describe setup react & p5

Since I haven't used p5.js before, I decided to start with the [exercise on drawing some simple shapes](https://digitalideation.github.io/gencg_f2301/notes/day01/#2-draw-then-code) with p5.js:

import { P5Tree } from "@/components/day1/P5Tree";

<P5Tree />

The code for this is pretty straightforward. I've added some [logic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5529199) to place the dots on the round tree at random positions inside the ellipse:

```js
function randomPointInEllipse(cx, cy, width, height) {
  // algo by: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5529199
  let rho = Math.random();
  let phi = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;

  // random coordinates inside the circle
  let x = Math.sqrt(rho) * Math.cos(phi);
  let y = Math.sqrt(rho) * Math.sin(phi);

  // scale to elipse
  x = (x * width) / 2.0;
  y = (y * height) / 2.0;

  return [cx + x, cy + y];
}

function drawRoundTree() {
  const cx = 100;
  const cy = 150;
  const width = 90;
  const height = 100;

  background(255, 0);
  clear();

  stroke(255, 255, 255);
  strokeWeight(4);
  noFill();

  // crown
  ellipse(cx, cy, width, height);
  // main trunk
  line(cx, cy - 15, cx, cy + 110);
  // side branch
  line(cx - 20, cy + 5, cx, cy + 35);

  // leaves
  for (let i = 0; i <= 50; i++) {
    const [x, y] = randomPointInEllipse(cx, cy, width, height);

    strokeWeight(Math.random() * 4);
    point(x, y);
  }
}
```

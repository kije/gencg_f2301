# Day 2 â€“ Grids & Iterative Patterns

## Grid

I started by creating an grid of simple boxes. In addition, I wanted to have a flexibale and easy to play around with grid layout system, so I invested some time in making it easy to change the number of tiles in x and y direction, as well as the margin between the tiles.

```js
const NUM_TILES_X = 10;
const NUM_TILES_Y = 7;
const TILE_MARGIN = 2;

const TILE_SIZE = PAGE_CONTENT_WIDTH / NUM_TILES_X - 2 * TILE_MARGIN;
const TILE_SIZE_WITH_MARGIN = TILE_SIZE + 2 * TILE_MARGIN;

function draw() {
  clear();
  stroke(255, 255, 255);
  strokeWeight(1);
  noFill();

  for (let x = 0; x < NUM_TILES_X; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < NUM_TILES_Y; y++) {
      const x0 = TILE_MARGIN + x * TILE_SIZE_WITH_MARGIN;
      const y0 = TILE_MARGIN + y * TILE_SIZE_WITH_MARGIN;

      rect(x0, y0, TILE_SIZE, TILE_SIZE);
    }
  }
}
```

<Grid1 numTilesX={10} numTilesY={7} />

<br />

After that, I tried to do a simple rotation

<Grid2 numTilesX={10} numTilesY={7} />

<br />

<Grid3 numTilesX={10} numTilesY={7} />

<br />

<Grid3 numTilesX={10} numTilesY={7} margin={20} />

<br />

<Grid4 numTilesX={10} numTilesY={7} />
